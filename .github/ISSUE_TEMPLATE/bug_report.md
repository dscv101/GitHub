## ü§ñ Claude Analysis Hints
*Hidden section for Claude Sonnet 4.1 optimization*

### Bug Analysis Priority:
1. **Critical/High Severity**: Focus on immediate stability and data integrity
2. **Performance Issues**: Profile first, optimize second - measure before/after
3. **Runtime Errors**: Trace stack, identify root cause, implement defensive coding
4. **Integration Failures**: Check version compatibility, configuration, and environment

### Code Investigation Strategy:
- Start with suspected files and error stack traces
- Use `@` syntax to examine related files if context is insufficient
- Look for recent commits that might have introduced the regression
- Check for similar patterns in the codebase that work correctly

### Fix Implementation Approach:
- Implement minimal viable fix first, then optimize
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations

### Testing Strategy:
- Write failing test first (TDD approach)
- Include regression tests to prevent reoccurrence
- Test with realistic data volumes and conditions
- Validate performance impact with benchmarks
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios

### Tool-Specific Considerations:
- **UV**: Check dependency resolution and version conflicts
- **Pytest**: Ensure test isolation and proper fixtures
- **Mypy**: Maintain type safety, add annotations if missing
- **Ruff**: Follow linting rules, fix any new violations
- **Bandit**: Address security implications of the fix
- **Pandas/Polars**: Consider memory efficiency and vectorization

### Environment-Specific Notes:
- **NixOS**: Ensure reproducible builds and environment consistency
- **SQL Server 13**: Check compatibility and query optimization
- **GitHub Actions**: Validate CI/CD pipeline compatibility

### Communication Protocol:
- Acknowledge bug severity and provide ETA for investigation
- Request additional context if retrieval fails to find relevant code
- Explain the root cause clearly in technical terms
- Provide step-by-step fix implementation plan
- Include prevention strategies for similar issues

### Auto-Labeling Rules:
```yaml
# Severity-based labels
Critical ‚Üí priority-critical, urgent
High ‚Üí priority-high, important
Medium ‚Üí priority-medium
Low ‚Üí priority-low

# Category-based labels
